# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Mega rocket gym readme

On the present [repository] (https://juanignaciosobral.github.io/BaSP-M2023/) we will find 5 main folders:

- Week-02
- Week-03
- Week-04
- Week-05
- Assets
- CSS

Every weekly folder contains an index.html file which is updated on every week's assignment.

## Week-02

This folder contains the main file for the second week's project, which is the basic HTML structure of [index.html](https://juanignaciosobral.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-02/index.html).
Index.html follows the main structure generated on [the following Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/q7xbVOHjKu9ofdssX15Jve/UI-kit-RR---B?node-id=701-367&t=l6S4d9vXKJCGhrmY-0) for the landing page of the Mega rocket gym, which was generated during the course's first week.

## Week-03

This folder contains the same HTML file as Week-02 ([index.html](https://juanignaciosobral.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-03/index.html)), but it incorporates some structure corrections made by tutors, such as the rearrangement and modification of some elements inside the file. It also incorporates the link to the CSS files reset.css and styles.css (both located on the CSS folder). By incorporating the CSS files we aimed to recreate the aftermentioned figma document on a pixel perfect scale.

## Week-04

This folder contains yet another HTML file called [index.html](https://juanignaciosobral.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04/index.html) that also incorporates some structure corrections made by tutors, as every week prior. This week's objective was also to recreate the aftermentioned figma document. However, this time we used flexbox in order to allow a responsive design for mobile and tablet devices, as well as desktop. We also differed from last week by using multiple CSS files for the many sections of the page instead of a single styles.css file.

## Week-04

This folder contains it's weekly [index.html](https://juanignaciosobral.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-05/index.html) file, but this time it comes with a twist. Instead of last week's CSS folder we will now find a Javascript folder, which contains 6 files. Each of those respective files is named after the main theme of the excercises that it contains. Therefore, this week's main assignment was to solve the excercises and link them into this week's index.html file.

## Assets

This folder currently contains another folder named images, which at the same time contains multiple images used on the making of the web page for Mega rocket gym.

## CSS

From week 4 onwards, each weekly folder will contain a CSS folder, which will also contain a reset.css file, as well as the multiple CSS files for every week's assignment.

## Future releases

On future releases we will incorporate some server-user content as well as working with peers via GitHub.

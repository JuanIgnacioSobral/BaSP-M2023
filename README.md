# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Mega rocket gym readme

On the present repository we will find 4 main folders:

- Week-02
- Week-03
- Assets
- CSS

Every weekly folder contains an index.html file which is updated on every week's assignment.

## Week-02

This folder contains the main file for the second week's project, which is the basic HTML structure of index.html.
Index.html follows the main structure generated on [the following Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/q7xbVOHjKu9ofdssX15Jve/UI-kit-RR---B?node-id=701-367&t=l6S4d9vXKJCGhrmY-0) for the landing page of the Mega rocket gym, which was generated during the course's first week.

## Week-03

This folder contains the same HTML file as Week-02 (index-html), but it incorporates some structure corrections made by tutors, such as the rearrangement and modification of some elements inside the file. It also incorporates the link to the CSS files reset.css and styles.css (both located on the CSS folder). By incorporating the CSS files we aimed to recreate the aftermentioned figma document on a pixel perfect scale.

## Assets

This folder currently contains another folder named images, which at the same time contains multiple images used on the making of the web page for Mega rocket gym.

## CSS

This folder currently contains the reset.css and styles.css files which, as mentioned before, were fundamental on fulfilling the third week's assignment.

## Future releases

On future releases we will incorporate some more CSS aspects to update index.html such as the usage of flexbox. It is also planned to include some JavaScript elements, in order to make the page more interactive.
We are also planing on creating the entire web service for the gym, which will include multiple user type pages, as well as a sign in and log in function.

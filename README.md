# Mega rocket gym readme

On the present repository we will find 2 main folders: 

- Week-02
- Assets

## Week-02

This folder contains the main file for this project, which is index.html. 
Index.html is an HTML file based on the main structure generated on [the following Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/q7xbVOHjKu9ofdssX15Jve/UI-kit-RR---B?node-id=701-367&t=l6S4d9vXKJCGhrmY-0) for the landing page of the Mega rocket gym.

## Assets

This folder currently contains another folder named images, which at the same time contains multiple images used on the making of the web page for Mega rocket gym.

## Future releases

On future releases we will include some CSS aspects to update index.html, as well as some JavaScript elements, in order to make the page more interactive.
We are also planing on creating the entire web service for the gym, which will include multiple user type pages, as well as a sign in and log in function.

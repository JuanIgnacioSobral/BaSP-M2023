## Mega rocket gym readme

On the present repository we will find 4 main folders:

- Week-02
- Week-03
- Assets
- CSS

Every weekly folder contains an index.html file which is updated on every week's assignment.

## Week-02

This folder contains the main file for the second week's project, which is the basic HTM structure of index.html.
Index.html follows the main structure generated on [the following Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/q7xbVOHjKu9ofdssX15Jve/UI-kit-RR---B?node-id=701-367&t=l6S4d9vXKJCGhrmY-0) for the landing page of the Mega rocket gym, which was generated during the first week.

## Week-02

This folder contains the same HTML file as Week-02 (index-html), but it incorporates some structure corrections, such as the

## Assets

This folder currently contains another folder named images, which at the same time contains multiple images used on the making of the web page for Mega rocket gym.

## Future releases

On future releases we will include some CSS aspects to update index.html, as well as some JavaScript elements, in order to make the page more interactive.
We are also planing on creating the entire web service for the gym, which will include multiple user type pages, as well as a sign in and log in function.
